# parkingProject
Personal project to build an app to keep track of where I've parked my car and reminders to avoid street sweeping tickets


## I see the approach to this project as:
1. consider data structure
2. consider api design
3. decide data design
4. decide api design
6. paper prototype front-end
7. build out back-end (test-driven)
8. build out front-end
9. additional security
10. front-end refactors for best practices
11. back-end rewrite (GO? Rails? Python?)
